# blind_auction
🎯 A simple Blind Auction app built with Python. Users enter bids secretly, and the highest bidder wins.

# 🕶️ Blind Auction Game (Python)

This is a simple command-line **Blind Auction** program written in Python.

## 🧠 About the Project

The program simulates a blind auction process where:
- Each bidder enters their name and bid amount secretly.
- The screen is cleared after each entry (so no one can see others' bids).
- Once all bids are entered, the program calculates the highest bidder and displays the winner.

This project is a beginner-level Python project, ideal for practicing:

- Dictionaries (`dict`)
- Loops (`while`, `for`)
- Conditional logic (`if/else`)
- Function definition and import
- Screen clearing using `os.system('cls'/'clear')`
